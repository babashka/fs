# babashka.fs

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/babashka/fs.svg)](https://clojars.org/babashka/fs)

File system utilities. This library is included in
[babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) (>= 0.2.9) but can also be used
from the JVM.

## Status

This library is pretty new. Breaking changes might happen, but we try to avoid
them if possible.

## Why

Babashka is a scripting utility. It's convenient to have cross platform file
system utilities available for scripting. The namespace `clojure.java.io`
already offers a bunch of useful features, but it predates java.nio. The nio
package isn't that nice to use from Clojure and this library should help with
that.

The main inspirations for this library are
[clojure.java.io](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.java.io-api.html),
[clj-commons/fs](https://github.com/clj-commons/fs) and
[corasaurus-hex/fs](https://github.com/corasaurus-hex/fs/blob/master/src/corasaurus_hex/fs.clj).

## API docs

API docs are available at [babashka.org/fs](https://babashka.org/fs).  Most
functions take a string, `java.io.File` or `java.nio.file.Path` as input and
return a `java.nio.file.Path`. Coercion into a `File` or `Path` can be done
using `fs/file` and `fs/path`.

## Usage

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.fs :as fs])
(fs/directory? ".") ;;=> true
```

## Examples

The `glob` function takes a root path and a pattern. The pattern is interpreted
as documented
[here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)).

``` clojure
(map str (fs/glob "." "**{.clj,cljc}"))
```

Output:

``` clojure
("project.clj" "test/babashka/fs_test.clj" "src/babashka/fs.cljc")
```

The function `exec-paths` returns all entries from `PATH` as `Path`s. To search
all these directories for an executable, e.g. `java`, you can combine it with
`list-dirs` which searches files directly in the directories using an (optional)
glob pattern:

``` clojure
(str (first (filter fs/executable? (fs/list-dirs (filter fs/exists? (fs/exec-paths)) "java"))))
"/Users/borkdude/.jenv/versions/11.0/bin/java"
```

For convenience, the above use case is also supported using the `which` function:

``` clojure
(str (fs/which "java"))
"/Users/borkdude/.jenv/versions/11.0/bin/java"
```

## Test

``` clojure
$ clojure -M:test
```

## Codox

Static files including compiled JS are hosted on Github. This is set up like
described
[here](https://medium.com/linagora-engineering/deploying-your-js-app-to-github-pages-the-easy-way-or-not-1ef8c48424b7):

All the commands below assume that you already have a git project initialized and that you are in its root folder.

```
# Create an orphan branch named gh-pages
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
# Remove all files from staging
git rm -rf .
# Create an empty commit so that you will be able to push on the branch next
git commit --allow-empty -m "Init empty branch"
# Push the branch
git push origin gh-pages
```

Now that the branch is created and pushed to origin, let’s configure the worktree correctly:

```
# Come back to master
git checkout master
# Add gh-pages to .gitignore
echo "gh-pages/" >> .gitignore
git worktree add gh-pages gh-pages
```

After cloning this repo to a new dir:

```
git fetch origin gh-pages
git worktree add gh-pages gh-pages
```

To deploy to Github Pages:

```
script/release
```
